<h2>Sample table</h2>

<p>This is a table of language courses with a column for each language
  and a row for each level.  The first row is entirely headers (with a
  gap at the start because the first column is row labels and so
  doesn't have a header).  The second and third level French courses
  are combined, so the cell for those has a "rowspan" set to make it
  extend into the next row, and the next row has one cell fewer, to
  make room for this.  You can also use "colspan" to extend cells
  sideways.</p>
