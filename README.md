My HTML teaching files
======================

Some files I wrote primarily for a polyglot friend who uses a
screen reader, who is learning about what is inside web pages.

This covers HTML itself, CSS, and some JavaScript.  It includes use of
the `lang` tag, to get screen readers to switch their text-to-speech
algorithms, and some audio CSS.
