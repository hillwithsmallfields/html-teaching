<h1>Using APIs</h1>

<p>A web API (Application Programming Interface) is a service provided
by a web server with input and output intended for use from programs.
It is accessed via http and https like the rest of the web, but the
"pages" it produces are meant for parsing by programs rather than for
display on the screen.  As they are usually some kind of textual data,
they may even be more suitable for screen readers than their regular
HTML page counterparts, as there's less scope for messing around and
sticking lots of rubbish in.  Also, they don't normally contain
adverts!</p>

<p>The output can be in any format, but two are commonest: JSON and
XML.  JSON is based on the subset of JavaScript that is used to write
pieces of data inline in programs; Python, and some other languages,
use much the same syntax for this, so it's a good match for writing
programs to use the data in many languages.  XML is like HTML, but you
can define your own sets of tags.  It's harder to parse, and not as
similar to data structures you'd typically want in a program, so I
suggest going for the JavaScript output if the server gives you a
choice.</p>

<h2>A quick introduction to JSON and data structures</h2>

<p>In the sample scripts in <a href="scripted-page.html">the scripted
page example</a> you can see some literal data in the form of
<code>"strings"</code>, which are surrounded in double-quote marks.
These can also be used in JSON.  You can also see the numeric
constants <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, and the boolean constants
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>; these all can also appear in
JSON.</p>

<p>There are two ways to make compound data structures in JSON (and in
programming languages that support JSON-like data): <dfn>lists</dfn>
and <dfn>dictionaries</dfn>.</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>Lists are simply sequences of values, and can be <dfn>indexed</dfn>
into by number, that is, you can refer to the <dfn>elements</dfn> of
the list by their position in the list, always starting from zero.
Lists are written in square brackets, with commas between the
elements.  In JavaScript, you could initialize a variable to hold a
literal list like this:</p>

<pre>
var herbs = ["tarragon", "thyme", "sage", "bay", "marjoram"];
</pre>

<h4>Using lists in programs</h4>

<p>Programming languages commonly use square brackets after the name
of a list variable to indicate indexing into the list, so
<code>herbs[2]</code> refers to the third element of
<code>herbs</code> (remember the first element is element zero).</p>

<p>In JavaScript, you could <dfn>iterate</dfn> over the elements of
the array like this, printing them to the console log (which you can
get at through your browser if running it as part of a web page):</p>

<pre>
for (var i = 0; i < herbs.length; i++) {
    console.log(herbs[i]);
}
</pre>

<p>JavaScript's <code>for</code> loop statement (for repeating things
with changing values of a control variable) has three things in
brackets after the keyword <code>for</code> (with semicolons between
them), and some statements after it, with curly brackets to delimit
the scope of the <code>for</code>.  The first thing in the brackets is
how to start the loop; the second is the condition for continuing it;
and the third is how to step from one value to the next.
<code>i++</code> is a short way of writing <code>i = i+1</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the same example in Python, which has a cleaner syntax and
is more powerful:</p>

<pre>
herbs = ["tarragon", "thyme", "sage", "bay", "marjoram"]
for h in herbs:
    print(herbs[h])
</pre>

<p>Further code snippets on this page will all be in Python; it's much
nicer than JavaScript!</p>

<p>You can also add things to a list:</p>

<pre>
herbs.append("oregano")
</pre>

<p>And you can overwrite elements of a list:</p>

<pre>
herbs[1] = "basil"
</pre>

<h4>Strings</h4>

<p>Strings can be treated as lists of characters, but you can't modify
them.  You can index into them by number, just like lists.</p>

<h3>Dictionaries</h3>

<p>Dictionaries are similar to lists, but contain <dfn>key-value
pairs</dfn>, and you can look things up in the dictionary by giving
the key, and will get the value back.  Dictionary literals are written
between curly brackets, with a colon between the key and the value,
and a comma between successive pairs; access to dictionary elements is
done using square brackets, however, just like for lists.  You can use
a wide variety of things as dictionary keys, except for anything that
you can modify.  (You can put anything in the value part of each pair).</p>

<p>The keys of a dictionary must be unique, and there is no concept of
what order the key-value pairs are in.</p>

<pre>
animal_types = {
    "cat": "feline",
    "lion": "feline",
    "dog": "canine",
    "fox": "canine",
    "wolf": "canine",
    "seal": "pinniped",
    "bear": "ursine"
}
</pre>

<p>Accessing a dictionary looks like this:
<code>animal_types["lion"]</code> which will yield
<code>"feline"</code>.</p>

<p>You can add elements to a dictionary like this:
<code>animal_types["spider"] = "arthropod"</code>.</p>

<h2>An example API: OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service</h2>

<p>Now we've seen enough of what JSON looks like to be able to make
sense of an example.  I picked a free example, part of the
openstreetmap system, that you don't have to register for, and which
provides a textual form of data that is normally presented on a map;
so this example has potential to be useful for accessibility.</p>

<p>Although the output is intended for reading into a program, it is
possible to access it through a normal browser, and you can make up
queries by typing them into the address bar of a browser.</p>

<h3>The URL format</h3>

<p>Query URLs normally have a question mark after the site and page
name, with a series of key-value pairs after it, with an equals sign
between the key and the value, and an ampersand between the pairs.  If
you need to put a space in the query, replace it with a plus sign.</p>

<p>The details are documented on the nominatim website
<a href="https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/api/Search/#parameters">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some examples.  You can simply follow the links from this
page to bring them up in your browser.  In Firefox, it will probably
do a fancy "folding" display, but it has a "Raw data" tab at the top
of the result page, which should give something more readable to the
screen reader.</p>
